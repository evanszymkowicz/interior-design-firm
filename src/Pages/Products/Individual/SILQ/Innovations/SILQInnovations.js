                        The idea for SILQ was clear; we wanted to create a chair thatâ€™s simple, more organism than machine. One that operates intuitively and invites the human body to participate in the experience.

                        To get there we pushed the boundaries of material science. Through explorations with carbon fiber, we achieved our vision. But it was a material process breakthrough that embodies the qualities of carbon fiber, that allows us to deliver on our aspiration at mass scale.
